## 📝 Project Overview

**Code for My Valentine** is a personal web project built to artistically express unspoken feelings.  
It draws inspiration from the ambiance of a coffee shop — warm, familiar, and quietly intimate — and translates that into an interactive digital experience.

Each section of the site conveys a different emotional layer, with the overarching theme being one of **quiet acceptance and hope for the future**.

> This is not a direct message, but a crafted experience — where the message lies between the lines, waiting to be discovered.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Explore **emotional storytelling** through web design  
- Practice **creative front-end development** with a thematic narrative  
- Deliver a **non-verbal expression of affection** in a subtle, respectful, and creative manner

## 🧱 Structure

The website consists of the following key sections:

- **A Missing Ingredient**  
  Introduces the emotional tone, conveying a quiet absence or longing.

- **A Coffee Order Placed for the Future**  
  A metaphor for patience, timing, and future possibilities.

- **A Table for Two**  
  A symbolic space set aside for shared moments that may or may not come to be.

- **Hidden Notes and Details**  
  Poetic and visual elements embedded throughout the site for those who explore deeply.
