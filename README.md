Code for My Valentine
A minimalist, coffee-themed website designed to subtly express heartfelt sentiments through thoughtful design and poetic metaphor.
Created by Kshitij.

📝 Project Overview
Code for My Valentine is a personal web project built with the intent to artistically express unspoken feelings. It draws inspiration from the ambiance of a coffee shop — warm, familiar, and quietly intimate — and translates that into an interactive digital experience. Each section of the site conveys a different emotional layer, with the overarching theme being one of quiet acceptance and hope for the future.

This is not a direct message, but a crafted experience — where the message lies between the lines, waiting to be discovered.

🎯 Purpose
To explore emotional storytelling through web design

To practice creative front-end development with a thematic narrative

To deliver a non-verbal expression of affection in a subtle, respectful, and creative manner

🧱 Structure
The website consists of the following sections:

A Missing Ingredient
Introduces the emotional tone, conveying a quiet absence or longing.

A Coffee Order Placed for the Future
A metaphor for patience, timing, and future possibilities.

A Table for Two
A symbolic space set aside for shared moments that may or may not come to be.

Hidden Notes and Details
Poetic and visual elements embedded throughout the site for those who explore deeply.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 for semantic structure

CSS3 for custom styling and layout
